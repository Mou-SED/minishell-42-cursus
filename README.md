## Description

This project involves creating a shell program written in the C language, enabling users to interact with their computers through an interactive interface. Implemented using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for optimal user experience, this feature-rich shell encompasses various functionalities including conditional operators, regular expressions (Regex), and parentheses.

## Platform Specific

The project can run on both Linux and macOS operating systems.

- Linux version: https://github.com/Mou-SED/minishell-42-cursus/tree/linux_os
- macOS version: https://github.com/Mou-SED/minishell-42-cursus/tree/iMac_os

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. make the executable

```
$ make
```

2. run the executable

```
$ ./minishell
```

## Road Map

- Parse shell commands.
- Execute simple commands, commands with pipes, and commands with input/output redirection.
- Implement Wildcard expressions for filename expansion.
- Implement conditional operators (`&&` and `||`).
- Handle parentheses.
